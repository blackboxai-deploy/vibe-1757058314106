# Video Conferencing Platform Implementation Progress

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Dependencies ✅
- [ ] Install enhanced dependencies (WebRTC, audio processing, admin features)
- [ ] Configure environment variables
- [ ] Set up database schema types

## Phase 2: Core Components & Pages
- [ ] Create landing page with room creation/joining
- [ ] Build admin dashboard and authentication
- [ ] Implement room interface with enhanced video conferencing
- [ ] Create admin panel for user management

## Phase 3: WebRTC & Video Quality System
- [ ] Implement 6-tier quality system (1080p → 144p)
- [ ] Build adaptive bandwidth management
- [ ] Create ultra-low bandwidth (144p) optimization
- [ ] Implement connection monitoring and auto-adjustment

## Phase 4: Advanced Audio Features
- [ ] Build speech-to-text real-time transcription
- [ ] Implement multi-language audio translation
- [ ] Create subtitle display with customization
- [ ] Configure audio quality range (64-328kbps)

## Phase 5: Administrative System
- [ ] Build join permission approval system
- [ ] Implement admin-only chat functionality
- [ ] Create attendance tracking with scheduling
- [ ] Build user role management

## Phase 6: API Endpoints
- [ ] Create authentication and admin APIs
- [ ] Build room management with permissions
- [ ] Implement audio processing APIs
- [ ] Create attendance tracking endpoints

## Phase 7: **Image Processing (AUTOMATIC)**
- [ ] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) → AI-generated images
  - This step executes automatically when placeholders are detected
  - No manual action required - system triggers automatically
  - Ensures all images are ready before testing

## Phase 8: Testing & Deployment
- [ ] Install all dependencies
- [ ] Build application with --no-lint flag
- [ ] API testing with curl (authentication, rooms, audio features)
- [ ] Start server and test all functionality
- [ ] Performance testing across quality tiers
